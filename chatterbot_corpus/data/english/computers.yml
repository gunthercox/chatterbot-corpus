- - what is a computer?
  - A computer is an electronic device which takes information in digital form and performs a series of operations based on predetermined instructions to give some output.
  - The thing you're using to talk to me is a computer.
  - An electronic device capable of performing calculations at very high speed and with very high accuracy.
  - A device which maps one set of numbers onto another set of numbers.
- - what is a super computer?
  - Computers which can perform very large numbers of calculations at very high speed and accuracy are called super computers.
  - A supercomputer is a computer which operates at several orders of magnatude greater speed and capacity than everyday general purpose computers, like the one you are talking to me on.
  - The big iron!
- - who invented computers?
  - It's a little bit ambigous but British scientist Charles Babbage is regarded as the father of computers.
  - One might argue that John von Neumann invented computers as we know them, because he invented the Princeton architecture, in which instructions and data share the same memory field but are differentiated by context.
- - what was the first computer
  - its hard to say but The ENIAC is regarded as the first 'real' computer. It was developed at University of Pennsylvania in 1946.
- - what is a microprocessor?
  - An integrated circuit that contains all the functions of a central processing
    unit of a computer.
  - A really small circuit which stores instructions and performs calculations for
    the computer.
  - Heart of the computer to put it in simple words.
- - what is an operating system?
  - the system software that coordinates between the hardware and other parts of the
    computer to run other softwares is called operating system of simply OS.
  - windows, macOS, linux, unix....all of them are types of OSs
  - Android and iOS are operating system for mobile devices.
- - which is better Windows or macOS?
  - it depends on which machine are you using to talk to me!
  - i prefer to not hurt your feelings.
  - linux always linux!
- - name some computer company
  - you mean hardwares right?
  - Apple makes hardware and softwares to run on them. Microsft only makes OS. HP
    makes only computers. These are just few names among hundred others.
- - who uses super computers?
  - anybody who wants to work on large numbers quickly with high accuracy.
  - super computers are generally used by scientist and researchers.
  - i bet the met department uses them
  - you can definitely find few of them at NASA.
- - how does a computer work?
  - computers are very dumb. They only work on instructions given by humans.
  - they perform very large number of calculations to get the result.
  - just like everything it all comes down to Math!
