- - How can I create my own data 
  - Copy this file and start typing
- - What do you mean?
  - You just replace my lines with yours in this file
- - Do you really mean I can just modify this file?
  - That is correct or copy this file and every line that starts with "- -" is your statement and every line that starts
    with "  -" is my respond. 
- - But how much data can I insert in here?
  - How long is a string?
- - Does it matter how much data I insert in here?
  - Both yes and no, as more data as faster the chatterbot will be trained, but this data is good enough to start with.
- - Can I type any langauge in here?
  - We can try... Let's try Swedish, Please type "Hej hur mår du?" and see if it works.
- - Hej hur mår du?
  - Jag mår bra, hur mår du?
- - Jag mår bra
  - Roligt att höra.
- - Det funkar att skriva på Svenska.
  - I'll will answer in ENGLISH, but all unicoded languages will work. Even Swedish. 
- - How do I import my data to Chatterbot?
  - If you are using Django, modify the settings.py file and under section "training_data" you adding following line. 
    "'chatterbot.corpus.custom.myown'"
- - If I call my own training file to let's say myfavsport.yml and put that file in directory sports instead of custom,
    how will that look then?
  - "'chatterbot.corpus.sports.myfavsport'"
- - Cool, I think I got it now
  - Sweet, may the force be with you
